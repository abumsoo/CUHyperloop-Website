      <h4>High Pressure Tanks</h4>
      The pod's primary method of propulsion comes high pressure Nitrogen tanks
      produced by Steelhead Composites. Originally designed for compressed
      natural gas, these tanks can support pressures up to 3600 psi. Three of
      these tanks would be pressurized to 3600 psi, providing a peak thrust of
      2000 N per tank (6000 N total). A rendering can be seen in Fig. (1).
      These tanks are relatively lightweight and have ports on both ends,
      allowing for the nozzle hardware on one side and a fill manifold on other.

      Nitrogen was chosen due to it's low cost and ease of accessibility. It's
      non-volatile and can be purchased relatively pure, reducing the need for
      additional filters. Additionally, since Earth's atmosphere is primarily
      Nitrogen, it has scalability benefits for full scale systems.

      Figure (2) shows the different parts of the thrust nozzle. The nozzle
      piping is straight with exception of the high pressure electronic valve,
      minimizing obstacles to the flow. The nozzle itself would be optimized
      for near-vacuum expansion with yet-undetermined chamber pressure. Since
      the chamber pressure is continuously decreasing as gas is expelled,
      selecting a single pressure for optimization is difficult and having an
      adjustable nozzle is overly-complex. Additional analysis is being
      conducted to determine the best pressure to optimize at. For safety, a
      manual in-line ball valve separates the electronic valve and the tank.
      This allows for safe transport of the pod after the propellant is loaded,
      yet prior to tube closeout. The final step in the pod loading procedure
      would be to open the manual safety valve. Additionally, all nozzle parts
      are certified to 6000 psi, yielding a factor of safety of 1.67.

      <h4>Low Pressure Tank</h4>
      A 4th, low pressure propellant tank is also stored on-board the pod. The
      purpose of the low pressure tank is to actuate the propulsion valves
      (item 4 in Fig. (2)) as well as actuate the pneumatic brakes.

      <h4>Piping, Manifold, and Electronics</h4>
      A single fill manifold allows tank pressures during propellant loading to
      remain equal. A separate plumbing system would be used to fill the low
      pressure tank for pneumatic control. Wherever possible, pipes would be
      solid tubing rather than flexible, reducing variations in tube diameter
      around corners and making management of internal systems less cluttered.

      Synchronization of the three thrust valves is key to a successful test.
      If the valves open asynchronously, imbalanced thrust could torque the
      vehicle off of the center rail. With the chosen electronic valves, the
      maximum time to open is 0.08 seconds, and the maximum software delay to
      each valve is capped at 20 nanoseconds. Additionally, all of the piping
      coming from each propulsion tank is of equal length, lending a further
      physical mechanism to syncronyze the thrust. Given this, we anticipate no
      problem with imbalanced thrust at the start of the thrust phase.
      Additional research and testing needs to be conducted to confirm this.
