      <h4>Shell Design</h4>
      In order to make cooling electronics easier, the chosen operating
      pressure within the tube was determined to be 10% atmosphere, or
      approximately 1.5 psi. As the pod will be operating in some atmosphere,
      an aerodynamic cover for the pod was required to reduce drag and protect
      internals as well as future passengers.

      Utilizing research done by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mopg/www/papers/OpgenoordCaplan_2017_Aerodynamics_Hyperloop_online.pdf" title="On the Aerodynamic Design of the Hyperloop Concept" target="_blank">Opgenoord and Caplan from MIT</a> and analysis
      conducted by <a href="http://azhyperloop.com/" title="AzLoop" target="_blank">AzLoop</a>, as well as internal simulation and analysis, the
      team decided to choose a shell the resembled an airfoil. Aside from
      producing less profile drag than a standard pill shaped pod, the airfoil
      geometry generates a small amount of lift in the thin atmosphere,
      resulting in a reduction in the effective weight of the pod. This reduces
      wheel friction. A number of design iterations like the one's shown in
      Fig. (1) were tested using Star-CCM+. Each model was simulated, areas of
      high pressure and turbulence were identified, and optimizations were
      performed to produce future iterations until the final design was chosen.

      The final design was simulated with a laminar model for aerodynamic
      constants and a K-Epsilon model for thermal profiles with a turbulence
      intensity of 0.01. The mesh, consisting of 578,000 cells, was tested at a
      velocity of 90 m/s at 1.47 psi. This resulted in a C_L of 0.013 and a C_D
      of 0.026. Flow velocity can be seen in Fig. (2). Anticipated lift and
      drag were 23.86 N and 47 N, respectively.

      </div>

      Thermal analysis was also conducted on the shell. Because of the low tube
      pressure, skin friction is low which resulted in shell temperature
      increases of only 4 K. Additional shell testing needs to be conducted to
      validate the aerodynamic models. Scale test models will be manufactured
      over the summer of 2018 and tested in a wind tunnel.
