      <h4>Frame and Structure</h4>
      The frame is designed to provide a platform for all components of the
      hyperloop pod. In order to remain modular, 80/20 Aluminum extrusion was
      used for the majority of the structure. In order to maintain stiffness,
      joints would be welded rather than fastened with traditional fasteners,
      as seen in Fig. (1). This provides for a strong, stiff
      frame, and mounting interfaces would be slotted into the 80/20 rails so
      they could be repositioned or removed at a later date.

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/design/weldLoc.png" alt="Welding locations on the pod frame">
        <p>Fig. 1: Locations of welds on the frame</p>
      </div>

      In addition to supporting the critical hyperloop systems, the pod is able
      to support a single, average sized human passenger. No life support
      systems are included, and due to the nature of our design and the scale
      of the test track, the ride for the passenger would likely be very
      uncomfortable (see Sections V.3.A and V.C of the <a href="http://cuhyperloop.com/TechRep2018.pdf" title="CU Hyperloop 2018 Technical Report" target="_blank">2018 Technical Report</a>).

      <h4>Attitude Control</h4>
      In order to remain upright and in line with the hyperloop test track, a
      tricycle wheel configuration was used for the ground interface and
      clamping stability wheels are used on the rail, as shown in Fig. (2). The
      main, weight bearing wheels were to be made of liquid-cast polyurethane
      around an aluminum cylinder. The tricycle configuration limited rotation
      along the roll axis and additionally limited the maximum translation if
      any of the stability wheels failed (the main tricycle wheels would be
      unable to jump the central rail in the test track).

      <div class="figure">

        <p>Fig. 2: Locations of the attitude control assemblies</p>
      </div>

      Suspension aligned in the forward, downward facing direction
      (see Fig. (3)) allowed the pod to skip over any track variances with
      ease. Additionally, the use of springs meant that there wouldn't be any
      compressed fluids or gases to worry about.

      </div>

      Figure (5) shows the configuration of the alignment wheels on the central
      track rail. These wheels are wider than the suspension stroke of the pod,
      meaning that even in full compression, the stability wheel will remain
      clamped on the rail.

      </div>

      <h4>Brakes</h4>
      Brakes which clamped onto the center rail were used to bring the pod to a
      stop after the test, as seen in Fig. (5) and (6). The brake pad was
      designed to be as large as possible in order to create the most friction
      and made of a yet-to-be-determined polymer so that it was softer than the
      central rail. The electronic linear actuators are able to output 4450N of
      dynamic force and 6000N of static force, with variable amounts being
      applied over time to allow for gradual, controlled decelerations.

      </div>

      For redundancy, the pod has two electric brakes and an additional 2
      pneumatic brakes, as shown in Fig. (7). When pressurized, the pneumatic
      actuators are able to clamp with 4670N of force, and automatically close
      if pod power is lost.
